Hello there! I'm Paulo, a 25 years old telecommunications engineer based in Santa Catarina, Brazil. I studied at the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina and you can find my bachelor's thesis, entitled *Secure and Reliable Firmware Update*, [here](https://wiki.sj.ifsc.edu.br/index.php/Atualiza%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_Firmware_em_Sistemas_Embarcados_de_Forma_Segura_e_Confi%C3%A1vel). Currently I'm working at the [Embedded and Distributed Systems Laboratory (LaSED *in portuguese*)](http://www.lased.ifsc.edu.br/), developing the [specification](https://www.sef.sc.gov.br/arquivos_portal/servicos/136/DAF_Especificacao_de_Requisitos_1.0.0.pdf) and the proof of concept of an embedded low-cost secure fiscal authorizing device for the state of Santa Catarina. 

I've mostly used `Python3` and `C++` in the past months, but I have some experience in  `Java`, `VHDL`, `MatLab` or `C` (~~do not ask me to write your front end page~~).

In my free time, I use to play online games ðŸŽ®, read books ðŸ“š and learn about financial market ðŸ“ˆ. Also, I do live coding and play games at [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/paulaogiga), feel free to follow me there!

You can reach me in my [e-mail](mailto:sellpaulof@gmail.com). Navigate through the sidebar to know more about my projects and publications and if you like my work, [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/paulosell) â˜•ðŸ˜›.
